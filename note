                    Node/Express-Server/Back End Technology

    Basic Commands
    ----------------
                
    1.create package.json file-->npm init

    2.To install Express-->npm i express  (i==install)

    3.install JWT Token-->npm i jsonwebtoken


    Basic Steps
    ------------

    1.create package.json file

    2.Install the framework used to create the server ,ie Express

    3.create index.js file (this is the entry point of the bank application)

    4.import express

    5.using this express we create server application
                
    6.set up the port number to the server app
    
    7.Resolving the user/client requests-which is in the form of HTTP request

        HTTP requests are-->GET,PUT,POST,PATCH,DELETE

        solving the requests by

            syntax:-server-app.http request(path,callback function)

            how to resolve the http request will be defined in the call back function
            Also all call back functions as well as functions in node will be arrow functions

    8.Resposne status code(response will be sent from server to client)

        1xx(100 series code)--type of response-->information responses

        2xx(200 series code)-->type of response-->successful rsesponses

        3xx(300 series code)--type of response-->Redirection messages

        4xx(400 series code)--type of response-->client side error responses

        5xx(500 series code)--type of response-->server side error responses

        Refer to--> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status

    9.JWT Token--JSON web token--used for user validation(whether the request is valid or not)

        9.1)2 steps is there
          
          1)Generate the token-->method used by the library to generate token is sign()

              For that we need to install the library that helps us to generate the token

          2)verify the token-->method used by the library to verify token is verify()

    10.Middleware- it is just like a software,before processing the request of clients ,if we need to perform any 
    
                   tasks like security checks we use middlewares.

                   so before processing the requests ,middleware will be processed,it acts like a function.

                   There will be 3 arguments=>requests,response,next

            10.1 creating middleware in 2 types

                10.1.1 Entire application specific(entire application goes through this middleware)
                
                10.1.2 Router specific(for certain APIs)

    
        




    My Notes
    ----------
    node modules--to keep the copy of third party modules

    JWT Token--JSON web token
